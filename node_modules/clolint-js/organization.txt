three directories

 - main -- the 'real deal': the npm library, with the main Clojure checking
     (branch: main)
 - publish -- for creating npm packages that don't include ignored files
     possible alternative: could learn to use .npmignore instead
     (branch: main, always does a fetch+merge, never does a push)
 - webapp -- the HTML/CSS UI for running in a browser (gh-pages)
